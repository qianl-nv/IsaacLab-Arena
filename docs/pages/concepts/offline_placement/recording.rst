Record and Replay Placement Poses
=================================

Use ``record_placement_layouts.py`` to prepare reusable initial poses before
policy evaluation. It solves placement relations, advances physics, and records
the final poses of accepted layouts. Replay loads those poses on reset without
solving or settling them again.

Each batch resets every environment to one solved layout. ``layouts_per_env``
sets the number of batches; four environments and four batches produce 16 attempts.

The examples use the existing Robolab environments with visualization enabled:
``clamp_in_right_bin`` for recording and replay, and ``smartphone_in_bin`` for rejection.

Sampling Workflow
-----------------

1. Record Placement Layouts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example records settled placement layouts from the ``clamp_in_right_bin``
environment.

Complete :doc:`../../quickstart/installation` using native ``uv`` or Docker.
For an installed native ``uv`` environment, activate it from the repository root:

.. code-block:: bash

   source .venv/bin/activate

For Docker, use the Arena container shell prepared during installation.
Run the following commands from the repository root in your chosen environment;
``python`` uses the configured Arena interpreter in either workflow. To run headless,
use ``render=false --viz none`` when recording and ``--viz none`` when replaying.

JSONL recordings can be replayed in another native or Docker installation with
compatible assets, physics-root names and reset settings.

.. code-block:: bash

   python isaaclab_arena/scripts/record_placement_layouts.py \
       env_spec=isaaclab_arena_environments/robolab/tasks/clamp_in_right_bin.yaml \
       output=outputs/placements/clamp.jsonl \
       num_envs=4 env_spacing=2 layouts_per_env=4 seed=42 \
       'viewer_eye=[4.0,4.0,6.3]' 'viewer_lookat=[0.6,0.6,0.3]' \
       settle.num_steps=120 \
       settle.validators.pose_shift.max_translation_m=0.015 \
       render=true --device cpu --viz kit

You should see four environments reset and settle over four batches.
Recording is successful when:

* the command exits without error and writes ``outputs/placements/clamp.jsonl``
  with at least ``settle.min_layouts`` accepted layouts (default 1);
* the file contains one complete layout per line, and its line count matches the
  reported accepted count;
* every saved layout passes all required solver checks and all enabled, applicable
  post-physics checks at the configured limits.

Partial acceptance is successful when these conditions hold. Counts and measured
motion can differ between machines. Rejected layouts must be excluded from the
file and have a reason in the console.

These environments use about 1 cm of ``On`` release clearance. This exceeds the
recorder's default 2 mm shift limit. The commands explicitly allow 15 mm of root
translation. Rotation limits remain 2 degrees and root-speed limits remain
0.1 m/s and 0.1 rad/s. These are example settings, not changed defaults;
use limits appropriate to the accuracy needed by your evaluation.

See :ref:`recording_robot_motion` for robot-motion and joint-state limitations.

The ``PickAndPlaceTask`` default camera looks at the pickup object's initial
position in the first environment, with an eye offset of ``[-1.5, -1.5, 1.5]`` meters.
The optional ``viewer_eye`` and ``viewer_lookat`` values frame all four environments
in simulation-world coordinates. Set both, or omit both to keep the task's view.

The command sets ``settle.num_steps=120`` environment steps. Arena's default
``decimation=8`` supplies eight physics substeps per environment step, giving
960 physics steps per settling batch.

The ``clamp_in_right_bin`` environment varies object positions without randomizing
tool orientations and has a small initial drop. Each reset also runs the Droid
embodiment's configured robot-joint reset event. The console prints enabled checks
and their settings, physics-step progress, and acceptance counts per batch.
If every layout in a batch fails solver validation, physics is skipped and no
physics-progress lines appear.

   :alt: Four batches of clamp_in_right_bin layouts in four parallel environments.
   :width: 100%

The GIF shows excerpts from the four settling batches.
The console shows progress and batch results in this format. Values in angle
brackets come from your run:

.. code-block:: text

   [placement] 480/960 physics steps
   [placement] batch 1/4: 4 solutions, <solver_passed> passed solver validation, <physics_passed> passed post-physics validation; overall 4/16 validated, <accepted> accepted
   ...
   [placement] batch 4/4: 4 solutions, <solver_passed> passed solver validation, <physics_passed> passed post-physics validation; overall 16/16 validated, <accepted> accepted
   Saved <accepted>/16 accepted layouts: outputs/placements/clamp.jsonl

An existing output file is never overwritten; choose a new path for each recording.

To compare repeated sampling, rerun with
``output=outputs/placements/clamp_repeat.jsonl`` and keep all other settings,
assets and runtime unchanged. Investigate changes in acceptance counts or failed
checks using both runs' commands, logs and JSONL files. No accepted-count tolerance
is established.

2. Inspect the Saved Poses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

   wc -l outputs/placements/clamp.jsonl
   head -n 1 outputs/placements/clamp.jsonl | python -m json.tool

The line count must match the recorder's accepted count. The second command shows
only the first record as a format example; it does not validate the whole file.
``source``, ``poses`` and ``validation`` are fields inside
``variations["scene.relation_placement"]``. Check that:

* ``source`` is ``"settled"``;
* ``poses`` contains physics-root names, including ``spring_clamp``, the bins and ``robot``;
* positions and quaternions contain finite numbers;
* ``physics_settled`` and ``pose_shift`` in ``validation.post_physics`` have
  ``passed: true`` and the settings shown above;
* ``articulation_link_shift`` has ``passed: null`` because no articulated task
  objects were selected. Robot joints are excluded from this check.

Positions are in meters in the local environment frame; quaternions are XYZW.
``validation.pre_physics`` holds the solver verdicts for the initial candidate.
``validation.sampling`` records the physics duration and ``embodiment_keys`` excluded
from link-shift checks.

3. Replay the Accepted Layouts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following :doc:`Experiment Definition <../concept_arena_experiments>` reuses
``clamp_in_right_bin`` and the saved JSONL:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../isaaclab_arena_environments/experiment_configs/settled_placement_replay_experiment.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :start-at: runs:

.. code-block:: bash

   python isaaclab_arena/evaluation/experiment_runner.py \
       --experiment_config isaaclab_arena_environments/experiment_configs/settled_placement_replay_experiment.yaml \
       --device cpu --viz kit \
       --output_base_dir outputs/placements/evaluation

The command should exit without error and write these files under
``outputs/placements/evaluation/<timestamp>/``:

* ``index.html``: the evaluation report to open in a browser.
* ``arena_experiment_result.json``: the Run result, with ``clamp_replay`` marked
  ``completed``.
* ``clamp_replay/episode_results_rebuild0.jsonl``: three completed episode records.

Task success is not expected with the zero-action policy. Completed episodes
confirm execution; they do not measure whether reset poses match the input file.

For another recording, copy the Experiment Definition and edit its
``environment.type`` and ``environment_builder.placement_layouts_path`` together
inside the Run. Pass the copy to ``--experiment_config``; the environment YAML
and JSONL paths are relative to the repository root.

With one environment, each reset loads the next record and wraps after the last
one. Restarting the command starts from the first record. Later motion depends on
the simulation and policy, so it does not by itself show a replay error.

See :doc:`../object_placement/relations` for parallel and partial-reset selection.

4. Check Rejected Placement Layouts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generate and record poses in the ``smartphone_in_bin`` environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   python isaaclab_arena/scripts/record_placement_layouts.py \
       env_spec=isaaclab_arena_environments/robolab/tasks/smartphone_in_bin.yaml \
       output=outputs/placements/smartphone.jsonl \
       num_envs=4 env_spacing=2 layouts_per_env=4 seed=42 \
       'viewer_eye=[4.0,4.0,6.3]' 'viewer_lookat=[0.6,0.6,0.3]' \
       settle.num_steps=120 \
       settle.validators.pose_shift.max_translation_m=0.015 \
       render=true --device cpu --viz kit

Layouts that fail a required solver check or an enabled, applicable post-physics
check are excluded from the file and reported with a rejection reason.
If fewer than ``settle.min_layouts`` pass, expect an insufficient-acceptance error
and no output file; otherwise, the success conditions from step 1 apply.
Use :ref:`recording_rejection_summary` to diagnose failures. If every layout passes,
recording succeeded but rejection handling was not exercised.

.. image:: ../../../images/offline_placement/smartphone_recording.gif
   :alt: Four batches of smartphone_in_bin layouts in four parallel environments, showing object motion.
   :width: 100%

This run prints the same progress and batch summaries, followed by any rejection
reasons. For example, a mouse pose-shift rejection has this format; values in
angle brackets come from your run:

.. code-block:: text

   [placement] 480/960 physics steps
   [placement] batch 1/4: 4 solutions, <solver_passed> passed solver validation, <physics_passed> passed post-physics validation; overall 4/16 validated, <accepted> accepted
   ...
   [placement] batch 4/4: 4 solutions, <solver_passed> passed solver validation, <physics_passed> passed post-physics validation; overall 16/16 validated, <accepted> accepted
   Rejected <count>: pose_shift: computer_mouse: moved <distance> m and rotated <angle> deg; limits 0.015 m, 2 deg

The mouse's layout is rejected when its translation exceeds 0.015 m or its rotation
exceeds 2 degrees. Other layouts can still pass. If too few pass, the command ends
with:

.. code-block:: text

   AssertionError: Accepted <accepted> layouts; need 1. Rejections: {...}

.. _recording_rejection_summary:

Understand the Rejection Summary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each ``Rejected`` line gives a reason and the number of layouts rejected for it.
When a pose-shift limit is exceeded, the message includes the object, measured
translation and rotation, and configured limits. Use the named
check to decide what to adjust:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 30 45

   * - Rejection
     - Meaning
     - What to check or change
   * - ``solver validation failed``
     - A layout failed a required solver check.
     - Read earlier solver diagnostics and check relation constraints and collision
       geometry. Increasing settling time cannot fix a solver failure.
   * - ``physics_settled``
     - Final root velocity is too high.
     - Inspect contacts and support. Increase ``settle.num_steps`` if motion is
       still decaying; more time will not fix an unstable placement.
   * - ``pose_shift``
     - A root moved or rotated beyond its limits.
     - Inspect the named object. For ``On`` relations, reduce ``clearance_m`` to
       reduce the release drop, or increase ``edge_margin_m`` to avoid support
       edges. Edit the relation's ``params`` in the environment's scene YAML.
   * - ``articulation_link_shift``
     - A task-object link shifted relative to its root.
     - Check joint initialization and contacts. A root-pose recording cannot
       preserve the changed joint configuration.
   * - ``missing required solver checks``
     - A required pre-physics result is unavailable.
     - Enable the required validator or fix its dependencies and source
       configuration; do not remove a required check to obtain a recording.

See :doc:`../object_placement/relations` for relation settings. Change validation
limits under ``settle.validators`` only when the new tolerance fits your evaluation.
Increasing ``layouts_per_env`` samples more candidates; it does not make rejected
layouts valid.

Acceptance and Limitations
--------------------------

All required solver checks and enabled, applicable post-physics checks must pass.
The post-physics checks share one settling pass:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 45 30

   * - Check
     - Measures
     - Default limit
   * - ``physics_settled``
     - Final linear and angular speed of every root, including the robot.
     - 0.1 m/s and 0.1 rad/s
   * - ``pose_shift``
     - Initial-to-final translation and rotation of every root.
     - 2 mm and 2 degrees
   * - ``articulation_link_shift``
     - Task-object link motion relative to its root; excludes robot embodiments.
     - 2 mm and 2 degrees

Configure ``settle.validators.<check>.<setting>`` to change a limit.
An inapplicable or disabled check is recorded as skipped, not passed; at least
one applicable post-physics check must remain enabled.

.. _recording_robot_motion:

.. list-table:: Supported Use Cases and Limits
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - Use case or setting
     - Support and limitations
   * - Rigid and articulation roots
     - Supported with writable roots, enabled pose resets, fixed root-reset poses
       and zero initial velocity. Replay restores root poses and zero root velocity.
   * - Object sets; ``RandomAroundSolution``
     - Unsupported for recording. Resolve sets to concrete assets and remove
       the pose modifier before recording.
   * - Randomized or per-environment root-reset poses
     - Unsupported. Additional pose-changing variations and callbacks must also
       be disabled for exact root replay.
   * - Robot motion and joint state
     - The robot is not frozen and may push objects. Only roots are recorded;
       robot joints are not acceptance-checked and use their configured resets
       during replay. The Droid examples randomize joint positions on reset.
   * - Articulated task objects
     - Link checks compare initial and final poses, not joint speeds or continuous
       stillness. Replay cannot restore joint changes that occurred during settling.
   * - Geometry and IK after settling
     - Not rechecked. Passing the enabled checks does not certify all contacts,
       reachability or a deterministic future trajectory; behavior also depends
       on environment settings, physics backend and device.
   * - Other variations, such as mass or visibility
     - Sampled normally but not stored in the pose recording. Match these settings
       and joint initialization when comparing replay behavior across runtimes.
   * - Reusing an environment for collection
     - Collection consumes pool entries and leaves the final state, including on
       failure. Reset events must reset required roots, joints and actuator targets;
       physics-only steps do not advance counters for reset events with a minimum
       step interval.
   * - A batch containing solver failures
     - If any candidate passes required solver checks, physics advances the whole
       batch. Solver-failed candidates remain rejected.

   :width: 100%

Python API
----------

With ``SimulationApp`` already running, use the recording workflow to build an
environment, collect accepted poses and write JSONL:

.. code-block:: python

   from isaaclab_arena.offline_placement.recording_config import PlacementRecordingCfg
   from isaaclab_arena.offline_placement.recording_params import PlacementRecordingParams
   from isaaclab_arena.scripts.record_placement_layouts import record_settled_placement_layouts

   settling = PlacementRecordingParams(num_steps=120)
   settling.validators["pose_shift"]["max_translation_m"] = 0.015
   summary = record_settled_placement_layouts(
       PlacementRecordingCfg(
           env_spec="isaaclab_arena_environments/robolab/tasks/clamp_in_right_bin.yaml",
           output="outputs/placements/clamp_python.jsonl",
           num_envs=4, env_spacing=2.0, layouts_per_env=4, settle=settling,
       ),
       device="cpu",
   )

The workflow owns and closes the environment. Inspect ``summary.accepted``,
``summary.attempted`` and ``summary.rejections`` to see the outcome. When fewer
than ``settle.min_layouts`` candidates pass, ``summary.output`` is ``None`` and
no file is written; otherwise it contains the output path. The command-line
entry point reports insufficient acceptance as an error.

For an environment you already own, ``record_placements_to_jsonl`` in the same
script accepts ``env``, an output path and ``num_batches`` and returns the same
summary. This helper leaves environment cleanup to its caller.

Both recording entry points detect ``ClutterOn`` relations from the scene assets.
Clutter scenes receive additional offline preflight checks, non-clutter pose-shift
semantics, and support-containment validation without a separate recording mode.

For the reusable library API, call ``collect_settled_placements`` to inspect
poses and rejection reasons in memory. It measures the scene's rigid and
articulation roots without enforcing recording or replay policies:

.. code-block:: python

   from isaaclab_arena.offline_placement.settled_placement import collect_settled_placements
   from isaaclab_arena.offline_placement.settled_placement_params import SettledPlacementParams

   try:
       result = collect_settled_placements(
           env, num_batches=4, params=SettledPlacementParams(num_steps=120),
           scene_assets=arena_env.get_placement_assets(),
       )
   finally:
       env.close()

``result.poses`` maps runtime scene names to accepted ``Pose`` lists in matching
order. ``result.validation`` contains the accepted ``PlacementOutcome`` values:
each has ``pre_physics`` solver verdicts and ``post_physics`` validator reports
with ``check``, ``passed``, ``reason`` and ``configuration`` attributes.
``result.accepted_indices`` and ``result.rejections`` identify the source
environment and reset batch, not an index into a stored pool.

The collector returns empty pose lists and rejection reasons when no candidates
pass. The recording wrapper separately enforces ``min_layouts``, validates replay
compatibility and adds sampling metadata to the saved JSONL. Asset definitions
are optional for collection; ``scene_assets`` supplies metadata used to distinguish
embodiments from articulated task objects, not a required definition for each root.

Both APIs perform sampling resets; an initial ``env.reset()`` is unnecessary.
Set ``log_progress=True`` on the collector to print validator settings, physics-step
progress and batch results. The recording script enables these messages by default.

Custom checks subclass ``PostPhysicsPlacementValidator`` in
``isaaclab_arena.offline_placement.post_physics_validation``. Implement
``validate(batch: SettledBatch)`` with one report per ID in ``batch.env_ids``, using
``self.report`` to retain settings and results. The batch includes all measured
root poses and velocities, and only the selected task-object link poses.
To add an importable check:

.. code-block:: bash

   +settle.validators.support._target_=my_project.validators.SupportValidator
