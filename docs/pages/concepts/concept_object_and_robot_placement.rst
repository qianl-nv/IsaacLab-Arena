Object and Robot Placement
==========================

Motivation
----------

Placement determines the initial poses of objects and, when configured, the
robot embodiment in an Arena environment. For a fixed environment, you can set
every pose manually. This becomes brittle when the selected assets or their
dimensions change.

Suppose you want a microwave on a table with a cracker box next to it. Manual
placement requires looking up the table height, measuring both objects, and
chaining those dimensions into world coordinates:

.. code-block:: python

   # Table surface: z = 0.42 m.
   # Microwave: 0.50 m wide and 0.30 m tall.
   # Cracker box: 0.064 m wide and 0.212 m tall.
   clearance_m = 0.01

   microwave_z = 0.42 + 0.30 / 2 + clearance_m
   microwave.set_initial_pose(Pose(position_xyz=(0.0, 0.0, microwave_z)))

   cracker_box_x = 0.50 / 2 + clearance_m + 0.064 / 2
   cracker_box_z = 0.42 + 0.212 / 2 + clearance_m
   cracker_box.set_initial_pose(
       Pose(position_xyz=(cracker_box_x, 0.0, cracker_box_z))
   )

If the table height or either object's dimensions change, every dependent
coordinate must be recalculated. Relation-based placement instead describes
the intended arrangement:

.. code-block:: python

   from isaaclab_arena.relations.relations import IsAnchor, NextTo, On, Side

   table.add_relation(IsAnchor())
   microwave.add_relation(On(table))
   cracker_box.add_relation(On(table))
   cracker_box.add_relation(
       NextTo(microwave, side=Side.POSITIVE_X, distance_m=0.01)
   )

``ArenaEnvBuilder`` collects these relations and prepares candidate layouts
during environment compilation. It applies selected layouts when environments
are created and reset.

   Spatial relations describe the intended layout. Arena optimizes poses
   against the relations and collision constraints together.

When to Use Placement Relations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use fixed poses when an Arena environment has one known layout. Use placement
relations for assets whose poses should be computed automatically, especially
when you need:

- layouts that adapt to different assets or asset dimensions;
- diverse but reproducible layouts across environments and resets;
- collision-aware placement among placed assets and fixed geometry;
- a shared layout description across parallel environments; or
- geometric relation checks and optional physics stability testing.

See
`pick_and_place_maple_table_environment.py <https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab-Arena/blob/main/isaaclab_arena_environments/pick_and_place_maple_table_environment.py>`_
for a complete Python environment definition.

System Overview
---------------

Arena turns one environment definition into layouts for environment creation
and resets. The builder collects assets, spatial relations, and placement
settings; the solver generates candidate layouts; validators evaluate them;
and the placer stores ranked layouts for each environment. Objects and
supported robot embodiments use the same pipeline.

Anchors and passive obstacles remain fixed: anchors serve as relation
references, while passive obstacles contribute collision geometry. The solver
computes poses for placed objects, objects selected from object sets, and
supported robot embodiments. Across parallel environments, object identity can
be homogeneous or heterogeneous.

Try It Out
----------

.. _placement-viewer-display:

Run a quick placement example from the repository root. The
``pick_and_place_maple_table`` environment already contains a Rubik's cube and
a bowl. The command below adds three registered objects, each with an
``On(table_reference)`` relation. The solver computes a collision-aware pose
for each one.

.. note::

   Commands using ``--viz kit`` require an available graphical display. In a
   remote or container session, configure display forwarding and set
   ``DISPLAY`` to the active X display, for example ``export DISPLAY=:1``.

.. code-block:: bash

   python isaaclab_arena/evaluation/policy_runner.py \
     --viz kit \
     --policy_type zero_action \
     --num_steps 100 \
     pick_and_place_maple_table \
     --additional_table_objects cracker_box mug tomato_soup_can

   :align: center

   Each run adds registered objects with different dimensions. The solver
   recomputes a collision-aware layout without manual pose changes.

Replace the names after ``--additional_table_objects`` with other registered
objects to see placement adapt to different dimensions and footprints.
