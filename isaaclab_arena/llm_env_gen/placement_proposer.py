"""Decide placement + task dispatch for a resolved scene.

``propose_placement`` is a pure transform from (ResolvedScene, SceneSpec)
into a ``Placement`` dataclass bundle — no source-string emission, no
file I/O. The env_writer consumes the bundle and renders it to a Python
module. Keeping the two concerns separate lets us:

  * Unit-test placement logic without parsing generated Python.
  * Insert feasibility gates (IK reachability, motion-plan validity)
    between propose and write, rejecting or tweaking a Placement before
    any file hits disk.
  * Swap the renderer later (e.g. emit a JSON scene description
    instead) without touching the proposer.
