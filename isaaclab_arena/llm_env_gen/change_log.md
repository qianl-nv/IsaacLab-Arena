# llm_env_gen — change log

## Xinjie Yao — 2026-05-05

### 1. What it can do

- **Two-stage interactive review** — opt-in via
  `auto_generate_env --review-entities` and / or `--review-graphs`.
  Stage 1 opens `$EDITOR` after the LLM parse so the user can swap to
  preferred USD names, fix roles / instance keys, and pin per-item
  `scale` values; the validator confirms every name resolves in
  `AssetRegistry`. Stage 2 opens after the resolver and lets the user
  edit the initial / final scene graphs; the validator rejects unknown
  subjects/targets, invalid kinds, self-loops, parent conflicts in the
  initial graph, background-as-containment-child, and reports full
  strongly-connected components for cycles. Errors are prepended as
  `// …` comments and the editor re-opens until clean. The two flags
  are independent — pass one, the other, or both.
- **Table-relative asset auto-scale** — the placement proposer now
  rescales each item against the tabletop bbox at gen time. Items
  whose authored size already lies in an acceptable band (manipulables
  3-24 cm on a 60-cm table; containers 6-42 cm) are left at scale 1.0,
  so most YCB assets are untouched. Outliers are pulled to the nearest
  band edge, clamped to `[0.1, 10.0]`. Containers are auto-detected as
  the targets of `in(...)` goals; a post-pass enforces
  `container_eff ≥ 1.5 × contents_eff` so `in(A, B)` stays
  geometrically possible. Articulated assets and anchors are never
  rescaled. Per-item `scale` in stage-1 review (`null` = auto, float
  = override) gives the user the final word.

### 2. What was added

- `isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/review.py` (new)
  - `_resolve_editor` — `$EDITOR` → vim → vi → nano → nvim, gated by
    `shutil.which` so a missing binary fails before Kit boots instead
    of crashing in the middle of the loop.
  - `_open_in_editor` / `_review_loop` — write seed JSON to a temp
    file (with `// …` instructions / errors), spawn `$EDITOR`, parse
    on save, re-open with errors prepended until validation passes.
  - `review_entities(spec)` — Stage 1. Materializes `instance_name`
    so graph keys stay explicit; auto-rewrites graph references when
    an item's `instance_name` (or background) is renamed in place;
    drops relations whose subject/target was removed. Validator
    checks registry membership, `background` tag, embodiment family,
    role, identifier-safety of `instance_name`, and per-item `scale`.
  - `review_graphs(resolved, spec)` — Stage 2. Validators: vocab,
    kinds, unary `open`/`closed` requires `target=null`, no
    self-loops, single `on/in` parent in initial, background not a
    containment subject, every non-background entity must be a
    subject in initial. Tarjan SCC reports the full cycle, not just
    one edge. Recomputes `goal_added` / `goal_removed` from the
    edited graphs.

- `isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/auto_generate_env.py`
  - `--review-entities` and `--review-graphs` CLI flags. Wired right
    after the background override (pre-resolver) and right after
    `Resolver().resolve(spec)` (pre-retry-loop) respectively, so the
    retry loop sees the user-curated state.

- `isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/schema.py`
  - `Item.scale: float | None = None` — Pydantic field. `None` lets
    the proposer auto-fit; explicit positive float overrides.

- `isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/placement_proposer.py`
  - `_AUTO_SCALE_ACCEPTABLE_BAND` — per-band-kind (`manipulable` /
    `container`) acceptable ranges as fractions of `table_min_xy`.
    `_AUTO_SCALE_MIN` / `_AUTO_SCALE_MAX` are hard clamps.
    `_IN_CONTAINER_MARGIN = 1.5`.
  - `_unit_xy_extent(asset_cls)` — module-cached longest XY of the
    asset at scale 1.0, opened via `compute_local_bounding_box_from_usd`.
    Returns 0.0 (skip) for articulations and Pxr failures.
  - `_compute_auto_scale(asset_cls, table_xy_bbox, role,
    is_container=False)` — returns 1.0 when the asset already lies in
    its band; otherwise pulls it back to the nearest band edge.
  - `PlacementItem.scale` — concrete float baked into the rendered
    env. Set during `_propose_items` from `Item.scale` (explicit) or
    `_compute_auto_scale` (auto). Container detection drives off
    `resolved.goal_added` (kind == `in`).
  - Post-pass after item construction: for every `in(A, B)` goal
    bumps the container's scale (never shrinks) so its longest XY is
    at least `_IN_CONTAINER_MARGIN ×` the contents'.

- `isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/env_writer.py`
  - `_render_item_decls` emits `scale=(s, s, s)` on the asset
    constructor only when `scale != 1.0`, so envs with all-default
    scales render textually identical to before.

## Xinjie Yao — 2026-05-04

### 1. What it can do

- **Reach-aware robot placement at gen time** — opt-in via
  `auto_generate_env --use-reach-solver`. Replaces the random
  `(edge, fraction)` sampler with a joint Adam solve that maximizes
  top-down IK reachability for the goal-bound items against a
  precomputed Franka workspace EDT. The selected
  `(edge, fraction, offset_m)` is baked into the rendered env module
  exactly as today's static placement is — generated env files stay
  declarative, no torch / scipy / EDT imports, no runtime IK code.
- **Continuous outward offset** — the robot's standoff from the table
  edge is now per-placement (was a hardcoded 0.1 m). The reach solver
  picks it from `[0.05, 0.40]` m so the workspace shell can be slid
  forward / back to better cover the manipulables. Random-sampled
  placements still default to 0.1 m.
- **Joint reach + placement POC** —
  `isaaclab_arena_examples/relations/joint_reach_solver_poc.py` runs
  the same solve standalone with no Isaac Sim in the loop, plotting
  per-edge top-downs + heading arrows + EDT slice + loss curves to a
  PNG. Used as the library that the gen-time path imports, plus as a
  sandbox for tuning slopes / loss terms.
- **Auto-import LLM-generated envs** —
  `isaaclab_arena_environments/llm_generated/` is now a proper
  sub-package. Canonical (un-suffixed) files there get registered at
  import time alongside hand-written envs;
  `_t<N>`-suffixed trial files are filtered out.

### 2. What was added

- `isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/placement_proposer.py`
  - `_BACKGROUND_TABLETOP_XY_BBOX` — gen-time approximate world XY
    bboxes per background. Coarse (the reach solver is robust to ~10%
    bbox error); refinable later by querying live Sim.
  - `ReachSolverCfg` — dataclass for `(npz_path, iters, seed)`.
  - `propose_placement(reach_solver=...)` — routes to either the
    existing random sampler or the new reach-aware sibling. Falls back
    to random for backgrounds not in the bbox catalog.
  - `_propose_robot_placement_via_reach` — builds a 3-`DummyObject`
    scene (table + goal subject + goal target) and runs the POC's
    `joint_solve` over all 4 cardinal edges in parallel, returns the
    lowest-loss `RobotPlacement`. Lazy-imports torch + scipy so plain
    proposer use pays no cost.

- `isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/env_writer.py`
  - `write_env(reach_solver=...)` forwards the config to
    `propose_placement`.
  - `_render_robot_pose` rounds `offset_m` to 4 decimals so the
    rendered Python literal is readable (was raw `repr`).

- `isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/auto_generate_env.py`
  - `--use-reach-solver` / `--reach-npz` / `--reach-solver-iters` /
    `--reach-solver-seed` CLI flags.
  - Builds `ReachSolverCfg` once, threads through both the per-attempt
    `write_env` and the canonical (un-suffixed) `write_env` at the end
    — without that second forward, the canonical file silently fell
    back to the random sampler.
  - Placement log line includes `off=…` so retries can be diagnosed.

- `isaaclab_arena_examples/relations/joint_reach_solver_poc.py`
  - `ReachField.from_npz` — loads the precomputed reach map and
    builds an outside-EDT (`scipy.ndimage.distance_transform_edt`).
  - `joint_solve` — Adam over `(object world XYZ, raw_fraction,
    raw_offset)` batched across the 4 edges; per-env yaw is a fixed
    cardinal rotation matrix (constant w.r.t. autograd). Loss terms:
    `On(table)`, reach (distance-to-reachable EDT, dominant),
    object-vs-object NoCollision (hard), robot-vs-object NoCollision
    (soft, ~100× weaker than reach so reachability wins ties).
  - Visualization: per-env top-downs with heading arrows + EDT slice +
    loss curves saved to PNG. CLI knobs include `--init_jitter_xy`,
    `--offset_range`, `--reach_weight`, `--robot_obj_collision_slope`,
    `--table_size`.

- `tools/franka_reach_top_down.npz` / `.png` — precomputed reach map +
  visualization. Used by the POC and by the gen-time reach path.

- `isaaclab_arena_environments/__init__.py` —
  hand-iterates top-level modules + recurses into the explicit
  `_RECURSE_SUBPACKAGES = {"llm_generated"}` list. Skips subpackages
  like `mdp/` whose `__init__.py` does
  `from isaaclab.envs.mdp import *` (which would pull
  isaaclab + numpy / scipy before SimulationApp boots and trip the
  OpenBLAS atfork crash inside Kit's startup). Skips `_t<N>`
  trial-file stragglers from aborted gen runs.

- `isaaclab_arena_environments/llm_generated/__init__.py` — make the
  directory a proper sub-package.

   --dwell_steps 600 avocadoPnPbowltable'
```

### 4. TODOs

- `_BACKGROUND_TABLETOP_XY_BBOX` values are coarse estimates. Add a
  one-shot tool that boots Sim once, captures
  `tabletop_anchor.get_world_bounding_box()` per background, and
  rewrites the catalog. The container's SimulationApp init currently
  segfaults on this host (OpenBLAS atfork inside Kit startup) — the
  measurement script needs to defer scipy / numpy imports until after
  Kit boots, or run inside an env-build context where Sim is already
  up.
- The reach term assumes top-down grasp orientation
  (`quat_wxyz=(0,1,0,0)` in the npz). For Open/Close-door tasks the
  approach is horizontal; either skip the term for those task plans
  or generate a second NPZ at the door-approach orientation and
  switch maps based on the resolved task.
- The robot-vs-object NoCollision currently models only the panda
  link0 mounting plate (~0.24 × 0.24 × 0.30 m AABB at object height).
  Modeling the arm sweep over the table as a forward-extending
  dynamic AABB would let the term meaningfully trade off against
  reach; today it almost never engages because the stand sits outside
  the table.

## Xinjie Yao — 2026-04-28

### 1. What it can do

- **Search instead of single-shot retry** — the auto-driver now drives a
  structured exploration each attempt: even attempts vary only the robot
  placement, odd attempts only the item placement seed, and the final
  attempt varies both. When a fix lands you can attribute it to the axis
  that changed, and the loop has predictable diversity (no two attempts
  resample the same axis back-to-back).
- **Save the Kit viewport per attempt** — `--save_render_dir <DIR>` on
  `auto_generate_env` / `run_reachability_check` captures the scene as
  `<env_name>_ik_success.png` or `<env_name>_ik_failure_<status>.png`
  via `omni.kit.viewport.utility.capture_viewport_to_file`. Pumps
  `omni.kit.app.update()` for up to 60 frames so the async write lands
  before teardown destroys the viewport.
- **Stay away from corners by construction** — robot edge sampling is
  `Uniform(0.3, 0.7)` along the chosen edge, so the base lands somewhere
  in the middle two-thirds of an edge rather than at a corner where IK
  reachability is tightest. The seed string folds in `--seed`, so a
  different `--seed` value shifts the sample sequence end-to-end.
- **Spread item placement seeds** — `placement_seed = base + item_idx *
  100`. The placement pool draws `max_placement_attempts=10` candidates
  from `seed..seed+9`, so naive `+1` strides leave the "best" layout
  almost identical across consecutive item_idx; a stride of 100 fully
  decorrelates them.
- **Auto-zoom the generated env's Kit viewer** onto the table — the
  generated module installs an `env_cfg_callback` that overrides
  `env_cfg.viewer` with `lookat = runtime bbox midpoint`,
  `eye = lookat + (1.0, 1.0, 2.5)`. Replaces the default
  `(7.5, 7.5, 7.5)` framing that put the EEF outside the visible
  region.
- **Diagnose the bbox itself** — every generated env prints the
  tabletop world AABB at build time (`[bbox] tabletop world AABB:
  min=(...) -> max=(...); size_xy=(w, h)`) so you can sanity-check the
  ray-trace assumption that min/max really span the table.

**Assumptions:** Same as the auto_generate_env baseline — generated
envs use a tabletop background mapped in `_BACKGROUND_TABLETOP_ANCHOR`
(`maple_table_robolab` is the default override) so
`get_world_bounding_box` returns the real tabletop corners. The
viewport capture path requires `--viz kit`; headless runs skip the
save with a log line. Trial and canonical files share a directory;
the cleanup glob removes `<canonical_stem>_t*.py` on success — ad-hoc
files with the same prefix would also be swept.

### 2. What was added

- **`isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/auto_generate_env.py`**
  - `robot_idx` / `item_idx` counters with the alternation rule
    described above. Each attempt logs the `change_note`
    (`"baseline"`, `"items only"`, `"robot only"`, `"both varied …"`)
    so the search trace is human-readable.
  - Item-seed plumbing: `args_cli.placement_seed = base + item_idx *
    100`; the base is the user-supplied `--placement_seed` if set,
    else 0.
  - Forwards `args_cli.seed` to `write_env` / `propose_placement` so
    the robot RNG mixes it in.
  - On success: writes a canonical `<env_name>.py` (no `_tN` suffix)
    keyed to the winning `robot_idx`, then sweeps every
    `<canonical_stem>_t*.py` in `out_dir` (this run's trials *and*
    stragglers from prior failed runs).
- **`isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/placement_proposer.py`**
  - `_propose_robot_placement(env_name, attempt, seed)` — RNG seed
    becomes `f"{env_name}#{attempt}#{seed}"` so a fixed
    (env_name, attempt, seed) triple is reproducible.
  - `_ROBOT_EDGE_FRACTION_RANGE = (0.3, 0.7)` — uniform sampling band
    that excludes corners while still covering the middle two-thirds
    of the edge.
  - `_DEFAULT_TABLETOP_MARGIN_M = 0.15` — items spawn at least 15 cm
    from the edge.
  - `propose_placement(...)` carries the new `seed` parameter through
    to the robot sampler.
- **`isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/env_writer.py`**
  - `write_env(..., env_suffix="", seed=None)` — `env_suffix` is
    appended to the env / class names so each trial registers a
    unique env (sidesteps Isaac Sim's gym + scene caches that
    silently inherit a previous attempt's `init_state` after a
    same-name re-registration on the third attempt onward); `seed`
    is forwarded into placement proposing.
  - `_render_module` walks inner relation specs when picking
    imports, so `Not(In(bowl))` now correctly emits both `Not` and
    `In` (previously dropped the inner kind, which broke at
    runtime with `NameError: 'In' is not defined`).
  - `_render_robot_pose` emits the (edge, fraction) → (x, y, qz, qw)
    block plus a per-edge cardinal yaw quaternion.
  - `_render_bbox_setup` adds a runtime print of the tabletop AABB
    (`[bbox] tabletop world AABB: min=… -> max=…; size_xy=…`).
  - The generated `get_env(...)` body now installs an
    `env_cfg_callback` that overrides `env_cfg.viewer` with a
    bbox-derived eye / lookat tuple — table is centred and the
    Franka EEF stays in frame.
- **`isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/reachability_utils.py`**
  - `--save_render_dir DIR` flag on the IK-reachability arg group;
    reused by both the standalone `run_reachability_check` driver
    and `auto_generate_env`.
  - `--dwell_steps` default 300 → 90 (~3 s at 30 Hz).
- **`isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/run_reachability_check.py`**
  - `check_reachability_for_arena_builder(arena_builder, args_cli)
    -> int` — extracted from `main()` so the auto-driver can call
    the IK gate inside its loop without re-booting Isaac Sim.
  - Finally-clause now calls
    `teardown_simulation_app(make_new_stage=True)` *before*
    `env.close()` (mirrors `eval_runner.py`). Without it the next
    `gym.make()` inherits stale prims and ignores the new env's
    `init_state`.
  - `_save_scene_render(env, save_render_dir, env_name, status,
    feasible)` — captures the active Kit viewport via
    `omni.kit.viewport.utility.capture_viewport_to_file`, pumps
    up to 60 `app.update()` frames so the async PNG lands.
  - `--save_render_dir` triggers no extra setup (no enable_cameras
    flag, no rgb_array path) — the viewport that `--viz kit` already
    renders is what gets saved.

### 3. Commands

```bash
# 10-attempt prompt → IK-feasible env, with viewport snapshots per attempt
docker exec isaaclab_arena-curobo bash -c "cd /workspaces/isaaclab_arena && \
  /isaac-sim/python.sh -m isaaclab_arena.llm_env_gen.auto_generate_env \
    --viz kit --num_envs 1 --max-attempts 10 --seed 17 \
    --save_render_dir /tmp/auto_renders \
    --prompt 'franka pick up avocado from the table and place it into a bowl on the table. there are other veggies on the table as distractor'"

# Inspect a trial render afterwards
ls /tmp/auto_renders                # avocadoPnPbowltable_t0_ik_success.png, ...
```

### 4. TODOs

- **Vary the canonical robot pose across re-runs of the same prompt.**
  With a fixed `--seed`, attempt-N's `(env_name, attempt, seed)` triple
  is stable. That's reproducible by design but means re-running with
  the same prompt + seed always starts from the same baseline; rotate
  the seed offset (or expose `--robot_placement_seed` separately from
  the rest of `--seed`) when you want diversity without changing the
  rest of the pipeline's randomness.
- **Sweep stragglers conservatively.** The on-success cleanup glob is
  `<canonical_stem>_t*.py` — anyone who hand-named a file matching
  that pattern would lose it. Probably fine in practice but worth a
  warning if the directory ever contains user-curated artifacts.
- **Door tasks ignore the new robot sampling.** `OpenDoorTask` /
  `CloseDoorTask` envs still rely on `RotateAroundSolution` to face
  the door, but the robot base placement is now drawn the same way as
  PnP — a cardinal-edge sample without door-aware filtering. Add a
  filter that prefers edges whose facing direction is consistent with
  the openable's door axis.

## Xinjie Yao — 2026-04-27

### 1. What it can do

- **Compute the Franka EEF reachability map** with batched cuRobo IK on GPU,
  standalone (no SimulationApp / Kit boot). 25³ = 15,625 voxels solve in ~24s.
- **Save reach-map artifacts** to disk: a `.npz` with success / pos_err /
  rot_err arrays + axis grids, and a 3-D matplotlib voxel render PNG with the
  robot base origin and an x/y/z axis triad overlaid.
- **Visualize the reach map inside Kit**, overlaid on a registered Arena env:
  green/cyan sphere markers at feasible voxels (split by IK pos-error median),
  red sphere at the robot base. Loads a precomputed `.npz` to skip cuRobo,
  so the only cost is Kit boot.

**Assumptions:**

- `isaaclab_arena-curobo` container running.
- For `viz_reach_map_kit.py`: top-level CLI flags must come **before** the env
  name positional (Arena's env subparser owns args after the env name).

### 2. What was added

**`tools/compute_reach_map.py`** *(new)*

- Pure cuRobo + PyTorch — imports `IKSolver` directly from `curobo.wrap.reacher`
  with `RobotConfig.from_dict(load_yaml("franka.yml")["robot_cfg"])`. No Isaac
  Sim env needed, so no SimApp boot.
- 3-D `torch.linspace` grid in robot base frame (`--x_min / --x_max / --y_min /
  --y_max / --z_min / --z_max`, default `[-0.4, 1.0] × [-0.9, 0.9] × [0.0, 1.4]`).
- Top-down EE quaternion (wxyz `[0, 1, 0, 0]`) by default; configurable via
  `--quat_wxyz`. `--num_seeds` controls cuRobo IK seed count (default 20).
- `--save_npz <path>`: stores `success`, `pos_err`, `rot_err`, axis grids,
  and the EE quaternion.
- `--save_png <path>`: matplotlib `Agg` voxel render colored by IK position
  error, with a red base marker at the origin, dashed plumb line up through
  the workspace, and an RGB axis triad. Works headless.

**`tools/viz_reach_map_kit.py`** *(new)*

- Brings up a registered Arena env (e.g. `avocadoPnPbowltable`) under
  `--viz kit` and scatters `VisualizationMarkers` sphere instances at every
  feasible voxel in world frame.
- Two reach-map sphere bins (`tight` green, `loose` cyan) split at the
  feasible-voxel pos-error median to show robust vs marginal reach.
- Separate red sphere marker (`/World/Visuals/reach_map_base`, radius 0.06)
  at the robot's world root pose.
- `--load_npz <path>`: loads the artifact saved by `compute_reach_map.py` and
  skips the cuRobo step entirely. Falls back to in-process cuRobo IK if no
  NPZ is provided.
- Robot world pose fetched via `wp.to_torch(robot.data.root_pos_w)[0, :3]`
  and same for `root_quat_w` (Isaac Lab exposes these as warp arrays, not
  torch tensors). Voxels in base frame are rotated to world via
  `isaaclab.utils.math.quat_apply` before being passed to `markers.visualize`.

### 3. Commands

```
# Compute the reach map and save NPZ + PNG (no Kit, ~25s on GPU).
docker exec isaaclab_arena-curobo bash -c \
  'cd /workspaces/isaaclab_arena && /isaac-sim/python.sh tools/compute_reach_map.py \
     --grid 25 \
     --save_npz tools/franka_reach_top_down.npz \
     --save_png tools/franka_reach_top_down.png'

# Show the reach map in the Kit viewer overlaid on avocadoPnPbowltable.
# Note: --load_npz must come BEFORE the env name positional.
docker exec isaaclab_arena-curobo bash -c \
  'cd /workspaces/isaaclab_arena && /isaac-sim/python.sh tools/viz_reach_map_kit.py \
     --viz kit --num_envs 1 \
     --load_npz tools/franka_reach_top_down.npz \
     avocadoPnPbowltable --embodiment franka_ik'
```

### 4. TODOs

- Loop over a small set of EE quaternions (top-down, side approach, ±yaw)
  inside `compute_reach_map.py` and store *fraction reachable* per voxel —
  smoother [0, 1] field, suitable as the differentiable proxy `W` for
  the placement-optimization design.
- Color the Kit reach markers by manipulability `√det(JJᵀ)` instead of (or in
  addition to) IK pos-error bins — cuRobo exposes the Jacobian at `q*`.
- Wire `viz_reach_map_kit.py` to honor the `--quat_wxyz` from the NPZ so the
  Kit overlay matches the orientation the map was computed for.

## Qian Lin — 2026-04-24

### 1. What it can do

- **Generate open/close door environments** from a natural-language prompt: `llm_env_gen` now produces `OpenDoorTask` or `CloseDoorTask` environments for articulated appliances (microwave, fridge, cabinet).
- **Relational placement for openable objects**: the microwave is placed ON the counter via the constraint solver (no fixed world position), with `RotateAroundSolution` locking its door to face the robot.
- **Correct tabletop anchor for kitchen background**: `ObjectReference` for the kitchen counter is created without `ObjectType.RIGID` (the sub-prim lacks `RigidBodyAPI`), preventing the previous `RuntimeError`.
- **IK reachability check for open-door tasks**: `run_reachability_check.py` auto-detects `OpenDoorTask`/`CloseDoorTask` and checks a horizontal front-approach pose at the door center.
- **Two generated microwave envs**: `microwaveOpenkitchen` (kitchen background) and `microwaveOpentable` (table background) are registered and runnable with `zero_action` policy.

**Assumptions:**
- Docker container `isaaclab_arena-curobo` (or `-latest`) must be running.
- `NV_API_KEY` env var required for LLM generation (`try_schema.py`).
- `--door_facing_axis -x` is correct for kitchen-background envs (microwave oriented by `RotateAroundSolution(yaw=-π/2)`).

### 2. What was added

**`schema.py`**
- `RelationKind` extended with `"open"` and `"closed"` literals — Pydantic validation gate for unary door-state relations.

**`placement_proposer.py`**
- `_OPEN_DOOR_KINDS`, `_CLOSE_DOOR_KINDS`, `_DEFAULT_OPEN_DOOR_EPISODE_LENGTH_S` constants.
- `_APPLIANCE_FACING_YAW` dict: maps `(background, asset)` → yaw for `RotateAroundSolution`.
- `_BACKGROUND_TABLETOP_ANCHOR_BASE_TYPE`: backgrounds whose tabletop sub-prim lacks `RigidBodyAPI` (currently `{"kitchen"}`).
- `TabletopAnchorPlan.anchor_object_type` field (`"RIGID"` or `"BASE"`); `_plan_tabletop_anchor` sets it per background.
- `RelationSpec.kind` extended with `"rotate_around_solution"`; new `rotate_yaw_rad` field.
- `PlacementItem.is_openable` flag; `_propose_items` detects openable subjects from goal diff and appends `RotateAroundSolution` after building the `On` relation.
- `TaskPlan.kind` extended with `"open_door"` and `"close_door"`.
- `_open_door_plan` and `_close_door_plan` task plan builders; `_plan_task` dispatches on goal kind.
- `block_initial_goal_satisfaction` skips `open`/`closed` goals (no `Not(...)` wrapping needed).
- `_derive_env_name` / `_derive_class_name` handle `target=None` for unary goals.

**`env_writer.py`**
- `_render_anchor_setup` respects `anchor_object_type`: omits `object_type=ObjectType.RIGID` for `BASE`-type anchors.
- `_render_one_relation` handles `"rotate_around_solution"` → `RotateAroundSolution(yaw_rad=...)`.
- Dynamic `relation_imports` now includes `RotateAroundSolution` when used.

**`llm_agent.py`**
- System prompt updated: explains `open`/`closed` unary relations, null target, initial/final graph semantics, and that distractors still need `on(distractor, background)`.

**`reachability_utils.py`**
- `find_open_close_door_task(arena_env)`: duck-typed task finder for `openable_object` attribute.
- `get_articulation_world_pos(env, name, env_id)`: root position from `scene.articulations`.
- `get_scene_object_world_pos(env, name, env_id)`: tries rigid objects, falls back to articulations.
- `get_object_pos_in_robot_frame` updated to use `get_scene_object_world_pos`.
- `door_approach_quaternion_wxyz(door_facing_axis)`: quaternion mapping `{-x, +x, -y, +y}` to a horizontal hand approach.
- `build_curobo_door_approach_pose(...)`: places hand `door_approach_offset` m in front of door center with horizontal orientation.
- New CLI args: `--door_approach_offset` (default 0.10 m), `--door_facing_axis` (default `-x`).

**`run_reachability_check.py`**
- `main()` auto-detects task type: tries `find_pick_and_place_task`, falls back to `find_open_close_door_task`.
- Refactored into `_check_pick_and_place(...)` and `_check_open_door(...)` helper functions.
- JSON payload and marker names adapted per task type.

**New environment files**
- `isaaclab_arena_environments/microwaveOpenkitchen.py` — kitchen counter background.
- `isaaclab_arena_environments/microwaveOpentable.py` — maple table background.

### 4. TODOs

- `isaaclab_arena_environments/microwaveOpenkitchen.py:87` — `# TODO(relation kind 'next_to' has no generator support yet)` for broccoli, sweet_potato, red_bell_pepper next_to microwave
- `isaaclab_arena_environments/microwaveOpentable.py` — same `next_to` TODOs for distractor veggies

## Xinjie Yao — 2026-04-23

### 1. What it can do

- **Randomize the robot base around the tabletop** on every regenerated env — a new `RobotPlacement` field in `Placement` samples one of the four tabletop edges (`x_min` / `x_max` / `y_min` / `y_max`), picks a fraction in `[0.4, 0.6]` along that edge, plants the base 0.1 m outside, and yaws it to face the table center. The avocado env now emits an `embodiment.set_initial_pose(...)` block driven by the runtime tabletop bbox rather than a hardcoded pose.
- **Seeded by env name** so regenerating the same env yields the same pose (`random.Random(env_name)`). Different envs → different edges; same prompt → reproducible pose.
- **Only emitted for tabletop-anchored backgrounds** (gated on `TabletopAnchorPlan.emit_position_limits`) so non-tabletop flows stay untouched.
- **Faster default viewer dwell** on reachability runs — `--dwell_steps` default dropped from 1500 (~50 s) to 300 (~10 s); bump it back up when you need longer manual inspection.

**Assumptions:** generated env uses a registered embodiment whose `set_initial_pose(Pose)` is wired through `EmbodimentBase._update_scene_cfg_with_robot_initial_pose` (verified for `franka_ik`). `no_embodiment` currently rejects `set_initial_pose` because its `scene_config` has no `robot` — use `franka_ik` for smoke tests that exercise the pose block. The template now materializes `_tbl_min_xyz` / `_tbl_max_xyz` **before** `embodiment = …`, so any downstream renderer must preserve that order.

### 2. What was added

- **`isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/placement_proposer.py`**
  - `RobotPlacement` dataclass — `edge`, `fraction`, `offset_m`, `z_m`, `rotation_xyzw`.
  - `Placement.robot_placement: RobotPlacement | None` — `None` when the background has no usable tabletop bbox.
  - `_EDGE_ROTATION_XYZW` — yaw quaternion table keyed by edge name (4 cardinal orientations).
  - `_ROBOT_EDGE_OFFSET_M = 0.1`, `_ROBOT_EDGE_FRACTION_RANGE = (0.4, 0.6)` — tunables kept at module scope so they're easy to find.
  - `_propose_robot_placement(env_name)` — seeded sampler wired into `propose_placement`.
- **`isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/env_writer.py`**
  - `_render_robot_pose(rp)` — emits the `_robot_x` / `_robot_y` / `embodiment.set_initial_pose(...)` block from a `RobotPlacement`, sharing one template across the four edges via compact axis-expr dispatch.
  - Template reordered: `{bbox_setup}` now renders **before** embodiment creation so the robot-pose block can reference `_tbl_min_xyz` / `_tbl_max_xyz`.
- **`isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/reachability_utils.py`** — `--dwell_steps` default dropped from 1500 to 300 (~10 s); help text updated to say "bump for longer inspection".
- **`isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/run_reachability_check.py`** — shrank the `_make_big_frame` default scale from 0.3 → 0.15 so the reachability target frame is still identifiable against Arena's 0.1 ee_frame markers without dominating the viewport.
- **`isaaclab_arena_environments/avocadoPnPbowltable.py`** — regenerated under the new pipeline. Sampled edge `x_max` at fraction 0.448 → Franka sits east of the table, yaw 180° facing inward. Verified with the `verify-env-with-zero-action` smoke test (500 steps, Kit viz, `franka_ik`, exit 0).

### 3. Commands

```bash
# Regenerate an env with a randomized robot placement
/isaac-sim/python.sh -m isaaclab_arena.llm_env_gen.try_schema \
    --background maple_table_robolab \
    --write-env isaaclab_arena_environments

# Smoke-test the regenerated env with franka_ik + Kit viz
docker exec isaaclab_arena-curobo bash -c "cd /workspaces/isaaclab_arena && \
  /isaac-sim/python.sh -u -m isaaclab_arena.evaluation.policy_runner \
    --policy_type zero_action --num_envs 1 --num_steps 500 --viz kit \
    avocadoPnPbowltable --embodiment franka_ik"
```

### 4. TODOs

- `no_embodiment` still crashes because its `scene_config` has no `robot` attribute — generated envs now unconditionally call `embodiment.set_initial_pose(...)`. Either guard the emit site on `args_cli.embodiment != "no_embodiment"` or make `NoEmbodiment.set_initial_pose` a no-op so the `verify-env-with-zero-action` skill keeps working.
- Robot placement currently ignores the pick/destination geometry — a future feasibility gate (IK reachability on both objects) should reject or resample placements where neither object is in the Franka work envelope from the sampled edge.

## Qian Lin — 2026-04-23

### 1. What it can do

- **Check IK reachability** for any Arena pick-and-place environment: given any `PickAndPlaceTask` + Franka embodiment, determine whether the pick object's pose is kinematically reachable (IK, collision-unaware) from the robot's initial configuration.
- **Check motion-plan feasibility**: if IK passes, run a full cuRobo collision-aware trajectory planner to confirm a collision-free approach path exists to the top-down grasp pose.
- **Visualize in Rerun**: stream robot collision spheres, EE trajectory, and world meshes to a Rerun viewer via X11, or save a `.rrd` file for offline replay when no display is available.
- **Tune IK thresholds** at the CLI (`--position_threshold`, `--rotation_threshold`) to probe borderline poses.
- **Bake cuRobo into the Arena Docker image** with a single rebuild flag (`-c`) — installs `cuda-toolkit-12.8` + cuRobo from pinned source; no manual container patching required.

**Assumptions:** `./docker/run_docker.sh -c -r` builds the `isaaclab_arena:curobo` image. The `install_cuda.sh` script is always present in the Arena source tree. cuRobo must be compiled from source (PyPI stub is non-functional). Rerun viewer version on the host must match the SDK in the container (currently `0.31.3`). Do NOT start `rerun` manually before running visualization — `rr.spawn()` inside the script owns the viewer lifecycle.

### 2. What was added

**`isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/check_ik_reachability.py`** (new)
- Arena-CLI-compatible entry point using the standard subparser pattern
- `_assert_franka_embodiment`, `_resolve_pick_object_name` — validate env constraints before cuRobo init
- `_build_curobo_target_pose` — top-down grasp target (TCP offset + configurable axis rotation)
- `_run_ik_reachability` — calls `motion_gen.ik_solver.solve_single`; returns position/rotation errors
- `_run_motion_plan` — calls `planner.update_world()` + `planner.plan_motion()`; collision-aware
- `_log_initial_scene` — unconditionally logs robot spheres + world meshes to Rerun regardless of plan success
- `--save_rrd PATH` with `rr.spawn` monkey-patch — saves recording to file, bypasses display requirement
- `--position_threshold` / `--rotation_threshold` CLI overrides for IK diagnostics
- `--visualize_plan` / `--visualize_spheres` flags (Rerun)

**`docker/Dockerfile.isaaclab_arena`**
- New `ARG INSTALL_CUROBO=false` block: re-COPYs `install_cuda.sh` (avoiding the GR00T block's unconditional `rm`), installs `cuda-toolkit-12.8`, builds cuRobo from pinned commit, persists `CUDA_HOME` via `/etc/profile.d/cuda.sh`

**`docker/run_docker.sh`**
- New `-c` flag: sets `INSTALL_CUROBO=true`, tags image as `isaaclab_arena:curobo`, passes `--build-arg INSTALL_CUROBO` to `docker build`

### 3. Commands

```bash
# Build the Arena Docker image with cuRobo baked in
./docker/run_docker.sh -c -r

# Run IK-only check (fast, no motion planning)
docker exec isaaclab_arena-curobo bash -c "cd /workspaces/isaaclab_arena && \

```

## Xinjie Yao — 2026-04-22

### 1. What it can do

- Spawn items **inside containers** via a new `In` containment relation — XY clamped to the parent's footprint, Z nudged just above the parent's rim so gravity completes the deposit. Replaces the long-standing TODO at `isaaclab_arena/relations/relations.py`.
- Generate envs through a **two-stage pipeline**: `propose_placement` (pure data transform → `Placement` dataclass) feeds `write_env` (thin renderer). Feasibility gates can slot in between without touching the renderer.
- **Override the LLM's background** at the CLI (`--background maple_table_robolab` is the default) — the full avocado scene swaps cleanly to the maple tabletop with `ObjectReference`-based anchoring and runtime bbox-derived `PositionLimits`.
- **Stable env names** regardless of the chosen USD — `_BACKGROUND_NAME_ALIASES` folds `maple_table_robolab`, `office_table`, `packing_table`, etc. under `"table"` and kitchen variants under `"kitchen"` for slug generation. The avocado env stays named `avocadoPnPbowltable` no matter which table USD drives it.
- **Smoke-test any registered env** via the new project-level `verify-env-with-zero-action` skill — Kit-viz by default, `no_embodiment` + `zero_action`, failure-to-fix hint table for the common bring-up errors.
- **Forbid initial states that already satisfy a goal** via a new `Not(inner)` relation + `block_initial_goal_satisfaction` stage in the proposer — the avocado env now carries `Not(In(bowl))` so the solver starts the avocado on the table, never already inside the bowl. Closes the Layer 2 negative-constraint TODO on `RelationSolver`.

**Assumptions:** Docker container running; `NV_API_KEY` on host for any LLM flow; `openai` pip installed inside the container; generated env files land under `isaaclab_arena_environments/` for auto-discovery; tabletop-style backgrounds are the only ones with a tested anchor / bbox path (`_BACKGROUND_TABLETOP_ANCHOR`); `Not(inner)` only wraps binary `Relation` subclasses (unary inners would need a separate solver dispatch).

### 2. What was added

- **`isaaclab_arena/relations/`**
  - `In(Relation)` class — XY containment without Z constraint at the relation layer.
  - `InLossStrategy(slope, z_slope_ratio=0.1, z_margin_m=0.02)` — XY band loss identical to `OnLossStrategy`, plus a soft Z-point term at `parent_rim + z_margin` scaled by `slope * z_slope_ratio`. `z_slope_ratio=0.0` recovers pure XY-only.
  - `Not(Relation)` wrapper — forwards `inner.parent` so the solver's binary-relation dispatch handles it without special-casing. Binary inners only for now.
  - `NotRelationLossStrategy(margin, slope)` — inverts the inner strategy's loss via `max(0, margin - inner_loss) * slope`. `inner_strategy` is injected by the solver at call time (no cached back-reference to the strategies dict, which would create a cycle the configclass validator recurses into).
  - New Not dispatch branch in `RelationSolver._compute_total_loss`: when it sees `Not(inner)` it looks up `_get_strategy(inner)` and threads it through as `inner_strategy=...`.
  - Registered as `In: InLossStrategy(slope=100.0)` and `Not: NotRelationLossStrategy(margin=0.05, slope=100.0)` in `RelationSolverParams._default_strategies`.
- **`isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/placement_proposer.py`** (new) — typed bundle (`Placement`, `PlacementItem`, `RelationSpec`, `TabletopAnchorPlan`, `TaskPlan`, `GoalBindingSpec`) with `propose_placement()` as the pure transform. Owns naming, anchor lookup, per-item relation planning (including `In`), and task dispatch. `RelationSpec` gains a `"not"` kind whose rendered form is `Not(inner)`, where `inner` is itself a `RelationSpec`.
- **`block_initial_goal_satisfaction(placement, resolved)`** (new, same module) — Layer 2a stage that walks `resolved.goal_added`, looks up each subject + target, and appends `RelationSpec(kind="not", inner=<on|in>)` to the subject's relations. Explicit `if kind == "in" / elif kind == "on" / else -> unsupported` dispatch so unhandled kinds land as visible TODO comments in the generated env. Also attaches a `GoalBindingSpec` so downstream feasibility gates can read "where should this item end up?"
- **`isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/env_writer.py`** (rewritten) — thin `write_env()` shim now chained as `propose_placement → block_initial_goal_satisfaction → _render_module → write`. Renders `In(...)` and `Not(...)` in addition to `On(...)` / `PositionLimits(...)`, factoring `_relation_call_expr(rel)` so `Not`'s inner is rendered without string surgery.
- **`isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/try_schema.py`** — new `--background` CLI flag (default `"maple_table_robolab"`) that patches `SceneSpec.background` and all matching relation targets after the LLM returns but before resolution.
- **`_BACKGROUND_NAME_ALIASES`** — alias map that folds background variants into short family names for env slugs.
- **`isaaclab_arena_environments/avocadoPnPbowltable.py`** — regenerated under the new pipeline: `maple_table_robolab` background + tabletop `ObjectReference` + bbox-derived `PositionLimits` per item + `PickAndPlaceTask` wiring (`pick_up=avocado`, `destination=bowl`) + `avocado_obj.add_relation(Not(In(bowl_obj)))` so the solver never initialises with the goal already satisfied.
- **`isaaclab_arena_environments/avocadoInBowlTest.py`** (new) — hand-authored test env exercising the `In` relation: bowl on the maple tabletop, avocado spawned `In(bowl)`. Observed init positions place the avocado's XY on the bowl's centre.
- **`.claude/skills/verify-env-with-zero-action/SKILL.md`** (new, project-level) — smoke-test skill with Kit-viz default and a failure→fix hint table.

### 3. Commands

```

### 4. TODOs

- `isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/placement_proposer.py` (`_BACKGROUND_TABLETOP_ANCHOR` docstring) — `get_world_bounding_box()` on a plain standalone table background doesn't account for the 90° Z rotation applied by the template, so PL derived from it clamps the wrong axes; prefer `ObjectReference` sub-prim entries until the asset layer handles pose-aware AABBs.

## Qian Lin — 2026-04-22

### 1. What it can do

- Generate a **pick-and-place** task env from a natural-language prompt — when the goal diff is a single `on`/`in` relation between two resolved items, the writer emits a `PickAndPlaceTask` (subject → `pick_up_object`, target → `destination_location`); everything else falls back to `NoTask` with per-goal TODO comments and a docstring note explaining why.
- Scan a folder (or every asset in `AssetRegistry`) of USD files and emit `object_catalog.json` with dimensions, physics properties, and semantic labels via pure `pxr` — no Isaac Sim runtime required. Read the catalog back with `--list-classes [--by-dataset]`.
- Register a fresh USD batch end-to-end via the new `isaaclab-arena-assetgen` skill: discover → catalog → `<basename>_object_library.py` with globally-unique `<basename>_<name>` keys → wire into `asset_registry.py` → USD-exists pytest.
- Run the converted `avocadoPnPbowltable` env with a real success predicate (avocado-in-bowl contact) instead of the old `NoTask` placeholder.

**Assumptions:**
- Docker container running; `NV_API_KEY` exported on host for any LLM-driven flow.
- `openai` picked up from the new `RUNTIME_DEPS` entry — requires `pip install -e .` (or image rebuild) inside the container.
- `isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/generate_catalog.py` as committed imports from `isaaclab_arena.scene_gen.catalog_utils`, but the helper was added at `isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/catalog_utils.py` — the import (or the module location) must be fixed before the script runs.
- Uncommitted working-tree edits are needed for the VOMP flow: `isaaclab_arena/assets/registries.py` gets `import isaaclab_arena.assets.vomp_object_library`.

### 2. What was added

- **`isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/env_writer.py`**
  - `_plan_task` / `_pick_and_place_plan` / `_no_task_plan` dispatch driven by `resolved.goal_added` / `goal_removed`.
  - Constants: `_PICK_AND_PLACE_KINDS = {"on", "in"}`, `_DEFAULT_PICK_AND_PLACE_EPISODE_LENGTH_S = 20.0`.
  - Generated module docstrings now carry a one-liner `Task wiring: …` so `head -n 20` explains which task got emitted.
  - Generated envs get inline `# goal_added (...)` / `# goal_removed (...)` comments documenting the success contract.
- **`isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/catalog_utils.py`** (new): `ARENA_ROOT`, `OBJECT_CATALOG_PATH`, `find_usd_files`, `iter_object_files`, `get_usd_rigid_body_info`, `get_dataset_from_path`, `load_catalog`, `print_object_info`. Pure `pxr`, no Isaac Sim runtime.
- **`isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/generate_catalog.py`** (new): CLI with `--objects`, `--output`, `--verbose`, `--list-classes`, `--by-dataset`. Falls back to `AssetRegistry` enumeration when `--objects` is omitted; rewrites absolute paths to repo-relative under `ARENA_ROOT`.
- **`isaaclab_arena_environments/avocadoPnPbowltable.py`**: retargeted from `NoTask` → `PickAndPlaceTask(pick_up_object=avocado_obj, destination_location=bowl_obj, background_scene=background, episode_length_s=20.0)` with task description preserved and the goal diff captured as comments.
- **`.claude/skills/`**
  - Top-level `SKILL.md` index and `isaaclab-arena-assetgen/SKILL.md` workflow.
  - `references/object_library_template.md` — minimal `LibraryObject` + `@register_asset` template.
  - New convention: a single `<basename>` drives the library filename, the catalog JSON path, and a `<basename>_<catalog_name>` prefix on every registered object → registry collisions impossible by construction.
- **`setup.py`**: `openai` added to `RUNTIME_DEPS`, consumed lazily by `isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/*`.

### 1. What it can do

- Parse a natural-language scene prompt into a validated `SceneSpec` (Pydantic).
- Resolve item names to concrete Arena assets with a traceable tag-preference + fallback pipeline.
- Extract both initial and final scene graphs from one prompt and derive the goal diff.
- Auto-generate a registered `@register_environment` Arena module with `NoTask`.
- Bring the generated env up end-to-end with `no_embodiment` + `zero_action`.

**Assumptions:** Docker container running; `NV_API_KEY` set on host; `openai` pip installed inside the container; writer output placed under `isaaclab_arena_environments/` for auto-discovery; the uncommitted `NoEmbodiment` registration fix applied for the no-robot path.

### 2. What was added

- **`isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/`**
  - `schema.py` — `SceneSpec` / `Item` / `Relation` Pydantic models; `identity()` for diffing; `goal_added()` / `goal_removed()` helpers; trivial-task `model_validator`.
  - `resolver.py` — `Resolver` with exact → substring → difflib fallback; tag preference (not hard filter); `IK_DEFAULTS` for bare robot family names; structured `TraceEvent` log including `diff.goal_added` / `diff.goal_removed`.
  - `llm_agent.py` — OpenAI-compatible Claude call against NVIDIA inference endpoint; schema injection; robust JSON extraction (fenced / brace-matching fallback).
  - `try_schema.py` — CLI runner with `--print-schema`, `--print-catalog`, `--write-env`; chains resolver and prints the trace.
  - `env_writer.py` — `write_env()` renders a complete env module; compact goal-derived naming (`avocadoPnPbowltable`); filename auto-derived when `out_path` is a directory.
- **`isaaclab_arena/relations/`** — TODO markers on the `In` relation (in `relations.py`) and on the `RelationSolver` negative-constraint requirement.
- **`docker/run_docker.sh`** — passes host `NV_API_KEY` through to the container when set, so `docker exec` no longer needs `-e`.
- **`isaaclab_arena_examples/agents/`** — example artifact directory with the committed avocado env.
- **Uncommitted**: `@register_asset` on `NoEmbodiment` + import in `embodiments/__init__.py`; writer template now emits `IsAnchor` + `set_initial_pose(Pose(...))` for background and ground plane; regenerated env file under `isaaclab_arena_environments/`.

### 4. TODOs

- `isaaclab_arena/relations/relations.py:129` — Implement `In` / containment relation (loss over parent's opening footprint, `IsInside` predicate for success checks).
- `isaaclab_arena/relations/relation_solver.py:31` — Support negative / not-holds constraints on initial placement so `ResolvedScene.goal_added` can be enforced.
- `isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/env_writer.py` (just above `item_decls`) — Support multiple instances of the same library asset (e.g. two bananas in one scene); re-introduce `instance_name=...` with a unique suffix.
- `isaaclab_arena/llm_env_gen/env_writer.py` (emitted into generated envs when a relation kind isn't supported) — `# TODO({rel['kind']}): no generator support yet for this relation kind.`
