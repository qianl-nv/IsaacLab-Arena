"""Object-settling predicate and recorder object.

The ``objects_settled`` predicate reports when all specified objects in the env come to a rest.
When an object settles, its initial resting position is recorded by the ``ObjectInitialRestPoseRecorder`` object.
Downstream predicates can read the positions via the ``get_object_initial_rest_state`` function.
Resetting and clearing of positions are handled by the progress tracker on env reset.
